There are 3 ways to use this config builder.

1) Regular Build, for this way you create a yml file for your configuration following the examples im the templates directory.  In the CLI 
   you only have to supply the yml file name.

2) Variable Build / Type File Build, for this way you create your yml file, but you also create a CSV with variables to fill out your variable 
   in your yml file.  This uses the standard Jinja2 variable format, see bellow. In the CLI you supply the name of the yml file, and the -t option
   and supply the variable CSV file name.
   
3) Auto Build, for this way you create a CSV that points to a "variableized" yml file.  This allows you to create one yml file that you can use
   over and over for a standard config.  This uses the standard Jinja2 variable format, see bellow.  In the CLI you use the -a and -t option and 
   supply the variable CSV file name.
   
The main differences between option 2, and 3 is that with option 3 the CSV file supplies the template file name.  Please reference the examples.
